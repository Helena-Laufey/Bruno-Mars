                <h3>Just The Way You Are</h3>
    
                
                <p>
                    Oh oh oh oh <br>
    
                    Oh, her eyes, her eyes <br>
                    Make the stars look like they're not shinin' <br>
                    Her hair, her hair <br>
                    Falls perfectly without her trying <br>
                    She's so beautiful <br>
                    And I tell her every day <br>
                    Yeah 
                </p>
                <p>
                I know, I know <br>
                    When I compliment her she won't believe me <br>
                    And it's so, it's so <br>
                    Sad to think that she don't see what I see <br>
                    But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?" <br>
                    I say 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I see your face (face, face...) <br>
                    There's not a thing that I would change <br>
                    'Cause you're amazing (amazing) <br>
                    Just the way you are (are) <br>
                    And when you smile (smile, smile...) <br>
                    The whole world stops and stares for a while <br>
                    'Cause, girl, you're amazing (amazing) <br>
                    Just the way you are (are) <br>
                    Yeah
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her lips, her lips <br>
                    I could kiss them all day if she'd let me <br>
                    Her laugh, her laugh <br>
                    She hates but I think it's so sexy <br>
                    She's so beautiful <br>
                    And I tell her every day 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh you know, you know, you know <br>
                    I'd never ask you to change <br>
                    If perfect's what you're searching for <br>
                    Then just stay the same <br>
                    So don't even bother asking if you look okay <br>
                    You know I'll say,  
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    When I see your face (face, face...) <br>

                    The whole world stops and stares for a while <br>

                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The way you are <br>
                    The way you are <br>
                    Girl, you're amazing (amazing) <br>
                    Just the way you are (are)
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I see your face <br>
                    There's not a thing that I would change <br>
                    'Cause you're amazing (amazing) <br>
                    Just the way you are (are) <br>

                    Just the way you are <br>

            <p>
                Easy come, easy go <br>
                That's just how you live, oh <br>
                Take, take, take it  <br>
                But you never give <br>
                Should've known you was trouble <br>
                From the first kiss <br>
                Had your eyes wide open <br>
                Why were they open?  
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Gave you all I had <br>
                And you tossed it in the trash <br>
                You tossed it in the trash, you did <br>
                To give me all your love is all I ever asked <br>
                'Cause what you don't understand is... 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'd catch a grenade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
                Throw my hand on a blade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
                I'd jump in front of a train for you (yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
                You know I'd do anything for you (yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
                Oh, I would go through all this pain <br>
                Take a bullet straight through my brain <br>
                Yes, I would die for you, baby <br>
                But you won't do the same
            </p>
            <p>
                No, no, no, no <br>
                Black, black, black and blue <br>
                Beat me 'til I'm numb <br>
                Tell the devil I said "Hey" when you get back to where you're from <br>
                Mad woman, bad woman <br>
                That's just what you are <br>
                Yeah, you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car
            </p>
            <p>
                Gave you all I had <br>
                And you tossed it in the trash <br>
                You tossed it in the trash, yes you did <br>

                If my body was on fire <br>
                Oh, you'd watch me burn down in flames <br>
                You said you loved me, you're a liar <br>
                'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby   
            </p>
